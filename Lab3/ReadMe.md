# Lab-3 Objects and Classes I
1. Create a class called Employee with three data members (empno, name, address) a method called readdata() to take in the details of the employee from user, and a function called displaydata() to display the details of the employee. In main create two objects of class Employee and for each object call the readdata() and displaydata() methods.


2. Create a class called Volume that uses three data members (length, breadth, and height) in terms of feet and inches to model the volume of a room. Read three dimensions of room and calculate volume it represents and print out the result. The volume should be in feet form i.e 12 feet 6 inches will be 12.5 ft.
3. Write a class description for a complex number, which is a combination of two parts real and imaginary of integral type. Write methods for addition and subtraction of two complex numbers.
Addition of two complex numbers:
Subtraction of two complex numbers:
(a+ib)+(c+id) = a+c+ib+id =a+c+i(b+d)
(a+ib)-(c+id) = a-c+ib-id=a-c+i(b-d)
4. Write a program to illustrate classes with an inline function outside class.
